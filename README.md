# Boon Circuit

This repository is for the next Boon runtime experiment: a static, circuit-like
engine that keeps Boon's local dataflow style while avoiding the cost of the old
actor engine.

The core direction is:

```text
No central reducer.
No runtime graph cloning.
Values are equations.
Collections are indexed equations over memory.
```

The first target is a Rust static-graph interpreter with a native Ply
playground. Rust/Zig codegen and hardware-oriented lowering come later, after
the semantics are proven on TodoMVC and 7GUIs Cells.

## Non-Goals For The First Pass

- Do not optimize or repair the original actor runtime.
- Do not use Differential Dataflow as the core engine.
- Do not make TodoMVC a reducer-style `event -> state -> update(state, event)`
  program.
- Do not clone a runtime subgraph for each todo row or spreadsheet cell.
- Do not require user-facing `KEYED LIST` syntax before proving that ordinary
  Boon `LIST` can lower to indexed storage.

## Proof Targets

The first implementation is only convincing if these are true:

1. TodoMVC source keeps the original local field-equation feel.
2. TodoMVC with many rows does not grow runtime graph topology per row.
3. Cells satisfies the 7GUIs behavior without hardcoded Rust app logic.
4. LIST changes propagate as keyed deltas to Ply, not as whole snapshots.
5. Browser/server runtime sync can exchange semantic deltas, not full state.
6. Every stateful value has a visible next-state equation.
